Today, we held the inaugural meeting of our journal club, <em>Gravity t-time</em>. During the session, we discussed the paper titled <em>"Matter really 
does matter, or Why f(R, Matter) type theories are significant for gravitational physics and cosmology"</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13594" target="_blank">arXiv:2408.13594</a>).
